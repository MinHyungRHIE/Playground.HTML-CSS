Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is.
The two display values are: block and inline.

Block-level Elements
    A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
        <body>
            <div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>
            <p>The DIV element is a block element, and will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
        </body>

        The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
        The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
        When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:

Inline Elements
    An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
        <body>
            <p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>
            <p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
        </body>

    The <span> Element
        The <span> element is often used as a container for some text.
        The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
        When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:
